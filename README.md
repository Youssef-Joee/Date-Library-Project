Created a comprehensive date manipulation library in C++ designed to facilitate effective handling and manipulation of date and time values. Key features include:

Date Representation: Implemented a robust structure for representing dates, including day, month, and year.
Date Calculations: Developed functionalities for date arithmetic, including addition and subtraction of days, and calculating the difference between dates.
Validation: Integrated validation methods to ensure correct date formats and handle edge cases like leap years.
Formatting Options: Provided multiple formatting options for displaying dates in various styles.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive interface for ease of use, enhancing usability for developers.
This project reinforced my understanding of data types and algorithms while improving my programming capabilities in C++.
